<h1>Question 1 –</h1>

Consider the following multi-layer perceptron.

Figure 1: Two layer multi-layer perceptron

For the set of input data

X

<em>calculate the output vector </em>y∈R<sup>6</sup>. You can assume that all activation functions <em>ϕ</em>(<em>ν</em>) are rectified linear units (ReLU), where

<h1>Question 2 –</h1>

For the following two-dimensional data sets, do the following:

<ol>

 <li>For each data set, design <strong>two </strong>different neural networks by hand which can discriminate between the classes (each class indicated by a different color).</li>

 <li>Code your solutions in python and verify that the network learns a decision boundarysimilar to what you designed. For this section, you should include plots showing the data and the corresponding decision boundaries learned by the networks.</li>

</ol>
